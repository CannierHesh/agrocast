**Main objective**
The goal of this study is to develop a mobile application that may use to solve the difficulties described above in our farming community.
We may collect requirements and information from  variety of stakeholders by employing the most appropriate approach, which is an ICT - Science based strategy. 
By fractionating and analyzing the accumulated data, we can give a superior service to each and every stakeholder.

**Main Research questions**
Although Sri Lanka is a fertile tropical land with great potential for the cultivation of a wide range of crops, 
the agriculture sector is hampered by deep-rooted productivity and profitability problems. Mechanization adaptation is low, 
as is a private agricultural investment. Natural disasters such as floods, droughts, and animal attacks confront the farming community every year, 
wreaking havoc on their lives and livelihoods, resulting in a high suicide rate among farmers. Even though Sri Lanka is geographically, intellectually, and biologically 
well-positioned to conduct research and development, little is being done in this field. When we looked at the primary issues in Sri Lankan agriculture, 
we observed a common set of predicaments, which are listed below,
* Post-harvest wastage since could not find retailers/consumers to sell organic products as farmers are not cultivating to meet demands.
* Insufficient importance on the development and production of nutrient-dense foods.
* Food preferences are shifting, as are concerns about how it is grown, with a greater focus on ethically sourced organic crops.
* Lack of traceability of products.
* Farmers abandon their plantations due to their incapacity to combat the various pests that attack them.
* Lack of market linkages and inability to analyze pricing due to lack of knowledge of market ups and downs.


**Individual research question**
1. Lack of market linkages and inability to analyze pricing due to lack of knowledge of market ups and downs.
2. Post-harvest wastage since farmers are not cultivating to meet demands.
3. Waste land resources due to hazard manual methods of working.
4. Inadequate attention to agricultural diversification in favor of crops that have better income prospects.


**Individual Objectives**
1. The goal of this component is to develop a reliable and user-friendly price forecasting dashboard that may use to solve the difficulties described above in our farming community.
2. The goal of this research component is to develop an intelligent system capable of forecasting market demand changes using past productivity and previous consumption data as inputs.
3. Through this research component, I hope to create a usable mobile application to the farming community with an intelligent system capable of identifying the best crops for existing lands by analyzing past data and environmental data as parameters.
4. When someone searches a crop by its name, the system provides all the required conditions such as Nitrogen Level, Phosphorus Level, Potassium Level, PH of soil, Temperature, Local humidity, and Rainfall during the season to the relevant crops.Â
